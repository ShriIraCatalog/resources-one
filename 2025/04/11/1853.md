# Chapter 2: Getting ready for Python 

## 2.1 Installing the Interpreter

Before we can write our first Python program, we have to download the appropriate interpreter for our computers.

We’ll be using Python 3 in this book because as stated on the official Python site “Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language”. In addition, “Python 3 eliminates many quirks that can unnecessarily trip up beginning programmers”.

However, note that Python 2 is currently still rather widely used. Python 2 and 3 are about 90% similar. Hence if you learn Python 3, you will likely have no problems understanding codes written in Python 2.

To install the interpreter for Python 3, head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/. The correct version should be indicated at the top of the webpage. We’ll be using version 3.6.1 in this book. Click on “Download Python 3.6.1” and the software will start downloading.

Alternatively if you want to install a different version, scroll down the page and you’ll see a listing of other versions. Click on the release version that you want. You’ll be redirected to the download page for that version.

Scroll down towards the end of the page and you’ll see a table listing various installers for that version. Choose the correct installer for your computer. The installer to use depends on two factors:

1. The operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and 
2. The processor (32-bit vs 64-bit) that you are using.
