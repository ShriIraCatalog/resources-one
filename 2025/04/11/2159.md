# Chapter 6: Making Choices and Decisions

Congratulations, you've made it to the most interesting chapter. I hope you've enjoyed the course so far. In this chapter, we'll look at how to make your program smarter, capable of making choices and decisions. Specifically, we'll be looking at the `if` statement, `for` loop and `while` loop. These are known as control flow tools; they control the flow of the program. In addition, we'll also look at the `try`, `except` statement that determines what the program should do when an error occurs.

However, before we go into these control flow tools, we have to first look at condition statements.

## 6.1 Condition Statements

All control flow tools involve evaluating a condition statement. The program will proceed differently depending on whether the condition is met.

The most common condition statement is the comparison statement. If we want to compare whether two variables are the same, we use the `==` operator (double `=`). For instance, if you write `x == y`, you are asking the program to check if the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`. If they are equal, the condition is met and the statement will evaluate to `True`. Else, the statement will evaluate to `False`.

Other comparison operators include `!=` (not equal). `<` (smaller than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (smaller than or equal to) and `>=` (greater than or equal to). The list below shows how these signs can be used and gives examples of statements that will evaluate to `True`.

Not equal: `5 != 2`

Greater than: `5 > 2`

Smaller than: `2 < 5`

Greater than or equal to: `5 > 2`, `5 >= 5`

Smaller than or equal to: `2 <= 5`, `2<= 2`

We also have three logical operators, `and`, `or`, `not` that are useful if we want to combine multiple conditions.

The `and` operator returns `True` if all conditions are met. Else it will return `False`. For instance, the statement `5 == 5 and 2 > 1`  will return `True` since both conditions are `True`.

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition is met. Else it will return `False`. The statement `5 > 2 or 7 > 10 or 3 == 2` will return `True` since the first condition `5 > 2` is `True`.

The `not` operator returns `True` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Else it will return `False`. The statement `not 2 > 5` will return `True` since 2 is not greater than 5.

## 6.2 If Statement

The `if` statement is one of the most commonly used control flow statements. It allows the program to evaluate if a certain condition is met, and to perform the appropriate action based on the result of the evaluation. The structure of an `if` statement is as follows:

```
if condition 1 is met:
    do A
elif condition 2 is met:
    do B
elif condition 3 is met:
    do C
elif condition 4 is met:
    do D
else:
    do E
```

`elif` stands for "else if" and you can have as many `elif` statements as you like.

If you've coded in other languages like C or Java before, you may be surprised to notice that no parentheses `()` are needed in Python after the `if`, `elif` and `else` keywords. In addition, Python does not use braces `{}` to define the start and end of the `if` statement. Rather, Python uses indentation. Anything indented is treated as a block of code that will be executed if the condition evaluates to `True`.

To fully understand how the `if` statement works, fire up IDLE and key in the following code.

```
userInput = input('Enter 1 or 2:')

if userInput == "1":
    print("Hello World")
    print("How are you?")
elif userInput == "2":
    print("Python Rocks!)
    print("I love Python")
else:
    print("You did not enter a valid number")
```

The program first prompts the user for an input using the `input()` function. The result is stored in the `userInput` variable as a string.

Next the statement `if userInput == "1":` compares the `userInput` variable with the string "1". If the value stored in `userInput` is "1", the program will execute all statements that are indented until the indentation ends. In this example, it'll print "Hello World", followed by "How are you?".

Alternatively, if the value stored in `userInput` "2", the program will print "Python Rocks", followed by "I love Python".

For all other values, the program will print "You did not enter a valid number".

Run the program three times, enter 1, 2 and 3 respectively for each run. You'll get the following output:

```
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Hello World
How are you?

Enter 1 or 2: 2
Python Rocks!
I love Python

Enter 1 or 2: 3
You did not enter a valid number
```

## 6.3 Inline If

An inline if statement is a simple form of an if statement and is more convenient if you only need to perform a simple task. The syntax is:

```
do Task A if condition is True else do Task B
```

For instance,

```
num1 = 12 if userInput == "1" else 13
```

This statement assigns `12` to `num1` (Task A) if `userInput` equals to "1". Else it assigns `13` to `num1` (Task B).

Another example is

```
print("This is task A" if userInput == "1" else "This is task B")
```

This statement prints "This is task A" (Task A) if `userInput` equals "1". Else it prints "This is task B" (Task B).

## 6.4 For Loop

Next, let us look at the `for` loop. The `for` loop executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the `for` statement is no longer valid.

### Looping through an iterable

In Python, an iterable refers to anything that can be looped over, such as a string, list, tuple or dictionary. The syntax for looping an iterable is as follows:

```
for a in iterable:
    print(a)
```

Example:

```
pets = ['cats', 'dogs', 'rabbits', 'hamsters']

for myPets in pets:
    print(myPets)
```

In the program above, we first declared the list `pets` and give it the members 'cats', 'dogs', 'rabbits', 'hamsters'. Next the statement `for myPets in pets:` loops through the pets list and assigns each member in the list to the variable `myPets`.

The first time the program runs through the `for` loop, it assigns 'cats' to the variable `myPets`. The statement `print(myPets)` then prints the value 'cats'. The second time the program loops through the `for` statement, it assigns the value 'dogs' to `myPets` and prints the value 'dogs'. The program continues looping through the list until the end of the list is reached.

If you run the program, you'll get

```
cats
dogs
rabbits
hamsters
```

We can also display the index of the members in the list. To do that, we use the `enumerate()` function.

```
for index, myPets in enumerate(pets):
    print(index, myPets)
```

This will give us the output

```
0 cats
1 dogs
2 rabbits
3 hamsters
```

To loop through a dictionary, we use the for loop the same way.

Example:

```
age = {'Peter': 5, 'John': 7}

for i in age:
    print(i)
```

You'll get

```
Peter
John
```

as the output.

If we want to get both the dictionary key and the data, we can do it this way:

Example:

```
age = {'Peter': 5, 'John': 7}

for i in age:
    print("Name = %s, Age = %d", %(i, age[i]))
```

The first time the program run through the `for` loop, it assigns 'Peter' to the variable `i`.

`age[i]` thus becomes `age['Peter']` which is equal to `5`.

When you run the program, you'll get

```
Name = Peter, Age = 5
Name = John, Age = 7
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `items()` method. This is a built-in method that returns each of the dictionary's key-data pair as a (key, data) tuple. Let's look at an example.

Example:

```
age = {'Peter': 5, 'John': 7}

for i,j in age.items():
    print("Name = %s, Age = %d"%(i,j))
```

You'll get 

```
Name = Peter, Age = 5
Name = John, Age = 7
```

The next example shows how to loop through a string.

```
message = 'Hello'

for i in message:
    print(i)
```

The output is

```
H
e
l
l
o
```

### Looping through a sequence of numbers

To loop through a sequence of numbers, the built-in `range()` function comes in handy. The `range()` function generates a list of numbers and has the syntax `range(start, end, step)`.

It start is not given, the numbers generated will start from zero.

Note: A useful tip to remember here is that in Python (and most programming languages), unless otherwise stated, we always start from zero.

For instance, the index of a list and a tuple start from zero.

When using the `format()` method for strings, the positions of arguments start from zero.

When using the `range()` function, if start is not given, the numbers generated start from zero.

If step is not given, a list of consecutive numbers will be generated (i.e step = 1). The end value must be provided. However, one weird ting about the `range()` function is that the given end value is never part of the generated list.

For instance

`range(5)` will generate the list `[0,1,2,3,4]`
`range(3, 10)` will generate `[3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
`range(4,10,2)` will generate `[4,6,8]`

To see how the `range()` function works in a `for` statement, try running the following code:

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

You should get

```
0
1
2
3
4
```
