# Chapter 6: Making Choices and Decisions

Congratulations, you've made it to the most interesting chapter. I hope you've enjoyed the course so far. In this chapter, we'll look at how to make your program smarter, capable of making choices and decisions. Specifically, we'll be looking at the `if` statement, `for` loop and `while` loop. These are known as control flow tools; they control the flow of the program. In addition, we'll also look at the `try`, `except` statement that determines what the program should do when an error occurs.

However, before we go into these control flow tools, we have to first look at condition statements.

## 6.1 Condition Statements

All control flow tools involve evaluating a condition statement. The program will proceed differently depending on whether the condition is met.

The most common condition statement is the comparison statement. If we want to compare whether two variables are the same, we use the `==` operator (double `=`). For instance, if you write `x == y`, you are asking the program to check if the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`. If they are equal, the condition is met and the statement will evaluate to `True`. Else, the statement will evaluate to `False`.

Other comparison operators include `!=` (not equal). `<` (smaller than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (smaller than or equal to) and `>=` (greater than or equal to). The list below shows how these signs can be used and gives examples of statements that will evaluate to `True`.

Not equal: `5 != 2`

Greater than: `5 > 2`

Smaller than: `2 < 5`

Greater than or equal to: `5 > 2`, `5 >= 5`

Smaller than or equal to: `2 <= 5`, `2<= 2`

We also have three logical operators, `and`, `or`, `not` that are useful if we want to combine multiple conditions.

The `and` operator returns `True` if all conditions are met. Else it will return `False`. For instance, the statement `5 == 5 and 2 > 1`  will return `True` since both conditions are `True`.

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition is met. Else it will return `False`. The statement `5 > 2 or 7 > 10 or 3 == 2` will return `True` since the first condition `5 > 2` is `True`.

The `not` operator returns `True` if the condition after the `not` keyword is false. Else it will return `False`. The statement `not 2 > 5` will return `True` since 2 is not greater than 5.

## 6.2 If Statement

The `if` statement is one of the most commonly used control flow statements. It allows the program to evaluate if a certain condition is met, and to perform the appropriate action based on the result of the evaluation. The structure of an `if` statement is as follows:

```
if condition 1 is met:
    do A
elif condition 2 is met:
    do B
elif condition 3 is met:
    do C
elif condition 4 is met:
    do D
else:
    do E
```

`elif` stands for "else if" and you can have as many `elif` statements as you like.

If you've coded in other languages like C or Java before, you may be surprised to notice that no parentheses `()` are needed in Python after the `if`, `elif` and `else` keywords. In addition, Python does not use braces `{}` to define the start and end of the `if` statement. Rather, Python uses indentation. Anything indented is treated as a block of code that will be executed if the condition evaluates to `True`.

To fully understand how the `if` statement works, fire up IDLE and key in the following code.

```
userInput = input('Enter 1 or 2:')

if userInput == "1":
    print("Hello World")
    print("How are you?")
elif userInput == "2":
    print("Python Rocks!)
    print("I love Python")
else:
    print("You did not enter a valid number")
```

The program first prompts the user for an input using the `input()` function. The result is stored in the `userInput` variable as a string.

Next the statement `if userInput == "1":` compares the `userInput` variable with the string "1". If the value stored in `userInput` is "1", the program will execute all statements that are indented until the indentation ends. In this example, it'll print "Hello World", followed by "How are you?".

Alternatively, if the value stored in `userInput` "2", the program will print "Python Rocks", followed by "I love Python".

For all other values, the program will print "You did not enter a valid number".

Run the program three times, enter 1, 2 and 3 respectively for each run. You'll get the following output:

```
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Hello World
How are you?

Enter 1 or 2: 2
Python Rocks!
I love Python

Enter 1 or 2: 3
You did not enter a valid number
```

## 6.3 Inline If

An inline if statement is a simple form of an if statement and is more convenient if you only need to perform a simple task. The syntax is:

```
do Task A if condition is True else do Task B
```

For instance,

```
num1 = 12 if userInput == "1" else 13
```

This statement assigns `12` to `num1` (Task A) if `userInput` equals to "1". Else it assigns `13` to `num1` (Task B).

Another example is

```
print("This is task A" if userInput == "1" else "This is task B")
```

This statement prints "This is task A" (Task A) if `userInput` equals "1". Else it prints "This is task B" (Task B).
