# Chapter 7: Functions and Modules

In our previous chapters, we've briefly mentioned functions and modules. In this chapter, let's look at them in detail. To reiterate, all programming languages come with built-in codes that we can use to make our lives easier as programmers. These codes consist of pre-written classes, variables and functions for performing certain common tasks and are saved in files known as modules. Let's first look at functions.

## 7.1 What are Functions?

Functions are simply pre-written codes that perform a certain task. For an analogy, think of the mathematical functions available in MS Excel. To add numbers, we can use the `sum()` function and type `sum(A1:A5)` instead of typeing `A1+A2+A3+A4+A5`.

Depending on how the function is written, whether it is part of a class (a class is a concept in object-oriented programming which we will cover in subsequent chapters) and how you import it, we can call a function simply by typing the name of the function or by using the dot notation. Some functions require us to pass data in for them to perform their tasks. These data are known as arguments and we pass them to the function by enclosing their values in parentheses `()` separated by commas.

For instance, to use the `print()` function for displaying text on the screen, we call it by typing `print("Hello World")` where `print` is the name of the function and "Hello World" is the argument.

On the other hand, to use the `replace()` function for manipulating text strings, we have to type

```
newString = "Hello World".replace("World", "Universe")
```

where `replace` is the name of the function and "World" and "Universe" are the arguments. The string before the dot (i.e. "Hello World") is the string that will be affected. Hence, "Hello World" will be changed to "Hello Universe".

Some functions may return a result after performing their tasks. In this case, the `replace()` function returns the string "Hello Universe", which we then assign to newString. If you print `newString` using the following statement

```
print(newString)
```

you'll get

```
Hello Universe
```

## 7.2 Defining Your Own Functions

We can define our own functions in Python and reuse them throughout the program. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

```
def functionName(list of parameters):
    code detailing what the function should do
    return [expression]
```

There are two keywords here, `def` and `return`

`def` tells the program that the indented code from the next line onwards is part of the function. `return` is the keyword that we use to return an answer from the function. There can be more than one return statements in a function. However, once the function executes a return statement, the function will exit. If your function does not need to return any value, you can omit the return statement. Alternatively, you can write `return` or `return None`.

Let us now define our first function. Suppose we want to determine if a given number is a prime number. Here's how we can define the function using the modulus (`%`) operator we learned in Chapter 3.4 and the `for` loop and `if` statement we learned in Chapter 6.

```
def checkIfPrime(numberToCheck):
    for x in range(2, numberToCheck):
        if (numberToCheck%x == 0):
            return False
    return True
```

The function above has one parameter called `numberToCheck`. Parameters are variables that are used to store the arguments that we pass in to the function.

Lines 2 and 3 uses a `for` loop to divide the parameter `numberToCheck` by all numbers from 2 to `numberToCheck - 1` to determine if the remainder is zero. If the remainder is zero, `numberToCheck` is not a prime number. Line 4 will `return False` and the function will exit.

If by last iteration of the `for` loop, none of the division gives a remainder of zero, the function will reach Line 5, and return `True`. The function will then exit.

To use this function, we type `checkIfPrime(13)` and assign it to a variable like this

```
answer = checkIfPrime(13)
```

Here we are passing 13 as the argument, which will be stored in `numberToCheck`. The for loop then runs to check if `numberToCheck` is prime and return either `True` or `False`. We can print the answer by typing `print(anser)`. We'll get the output: `True`.

## 7.3 Variable Scope

An important concept to understand when defining a function is the concept of variable scope. Variables defined inside a function are treated differently than variables defined outside. There are two main differences.

Firstly, any variable declared inside a function is only accessible within the function. These are known as local variables. Any variable declared outside a function is known as a global variable and is accessible anywhere in the program.

To understand this, try the code below:

```
message1 = "Global Variable"

def myFunction():
    print("\nINSIDE THE FUNCTION")
    # Global variables are accessible inside a function
    print(message1)
    # Declaring a local variable
    message2 = "Local Variable"
    print(message2)

'''
Calling the function
Note that myFunction() has no parameters.
Hence, when we call this function,
we use a pair of empty parentheses.
'''

myFunction()

print("\nOUTSIDE THE FUNCTION")

# Global variables are accessible outside function
print(message1)

# Local variables are NOT accessible outside function.
print(message2)

```

If you run the program, you will get the output below.

```
INSIDE THE FUNCTION
Global Variable
Local Variable

OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION
Global Variable
NameError: name 'message2' is not defined
```

In the code above, `message1` is a global variable while `message2` is a local variable declared inside the function `myFunction()`. Within the function, both the local and global variables are accessible. Outside the function, the local variable `message2` is no longer accessible. We get a `NameError` when we try to access it outside the function.

The second concept to understand about variable scope is that if a local variable shares the same name as a global variable, any code inside the function is accessing the local variable. Any code outside is accessing the global variable. Try running the code below

```
message1 = "Global Variable (shares same name as a local variable)"

def myFunction():
    message1 = "Local Variable (shares same name as a global variable)"
    print("\nINSIDE THE FUNCTION")
    print(message1)

# Calling the function
myFunction()

# Printing message1 OUTSIDE the function
print("\nOUTSIDE THE FUNCTION")
print(message1)
```

You'll get the output as follows:

```
INSIDE THE FUNCTION
Local Variable (shares same name as a global variable)

OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION
Global Variable (shares same name as a local variable)
```

When we print `message` inside the function, it prints "Local Variable (shares same name as a global variable)" as it is printing the local variable. When we print it outside, it is accessing the global variable and hence prints "Global Variable (shares same name as a local variable)".
