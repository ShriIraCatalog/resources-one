# Project: Math and Binary

Congratulations! We've now covered enough fundamentals of Python (and programming in general) to start coding our first full program. In this chapter, we're going to code a sample console game that consists of two mini games - a Mathematics game and a Binary game.

Af the start of the game, users can choose if they want to play the math or binary game. In addition, they'll also be prompted to enter the number of questions that they want for that round. They must choose to answer between 1 to 10 questions per round.

The math game tests our understanding of the BODMAS rule of arithmetic calculation. If you are unsure what BODMAS is, you can check out this site [https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-bodmas.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-bodmas.html).

The binary game, on the other hand, requires players to convert a base 10 number to a binary (base 2) number. If you are new to binary numbers, check out this article [https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html).

In both cases, the game randomly sets a question for players to answer. If they get the answer wrong, the program will display the correct answer and proceed to the next question. If they get it correct, the program will update their scores and proceed to the next question.

The program keeps track of the player's scores and saves those scores in an external text file. After each round, players can key "-1" to terminate the program or press Enter to start a new round.

I've broken down the program into small exercises so that you can try coding the program yourself. Try the exercises before referring to the answers. Answers are provided in Appendix E or you can go to https://shirira.one to download the Python files. I would strongly encourage you to download the source code as the formatting in Appendix E may result in the distortion of some indentations which makes the code difficult to read.
