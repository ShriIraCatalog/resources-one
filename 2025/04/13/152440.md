return score

Explanation

Starting from the second item (i.e. index = 1) in symbolList, the line if index >
0 and symbolList[index-1] == **': checks if the previous item in symbolList is
the ** symbol.

If itis, the statement symbolList[index] = operatorDict[randint(1, 3)] will
execute. In this case, the range given to the randint function is from 1 to

3. Hence, the ** symbol, which has a key of 4 in operatorDict will NOT be
assigned to symbolList[index].
On the other hand, if it is not, the statement symbolList[index] =
operatorDict[randint(1, 4)] will execute. Since the range given to the randint
function is 1 to 4, the numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 will be generated. Hence, the
symbols +, -, * or ** will be assigned to symbolList[index].

Exercise 3.2

try:

In this game, you will be given a simple arithmetic question.
Each correct answer gives you one mark.

No mark is deducted for wrong answers.

binaryInstructions = ""
In this game, you will be given a number in base 10.
Your task is to convert this number to base 2.
Each correct answer gives you one mark.

No mark is deducted for wrong answers.
